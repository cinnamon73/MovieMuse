# Security & Privacy Implementation Summary

## ✅ Checklist Completion Status

### **5. Security & Privacy** - COMPLETED

- [x] **Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text (SharedPreferences is not encrypted)**
- [x] **Add a privacy policy if you collect or store user data**  
- [x] **Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)**

## Implementation Details

### 1. Secure Data Storage ✅

**Problem**: SharedPreferences stores data in plain text, which is not secure for sensitive user data.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **SecureStorageService**: Created comprehensive encryption service using AES-256
- **Platform-specific security**: 
  - Android: EncryptedSharedPreferences with RSA_ECB_PKCS1Padding + AES_GCM_NoPadding
  - iOS: Keychain with first_unlock_this_device accessibility
- **Automatic migration**: Seamlessly migrates existing plain text data to encrypted storage
- **Selective encryption**: Only sensitive data is encrypted (user preferences, ratings, history)

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `lib/services/secure_storage_service.dart` - New encryption service
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added security dependencies
- `lib/main.dart` - Integrated secure storage initialization

### 2. Privacy Policy Implementation ✅

**Problem**: App collects user data but has no privacy policy.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Comprehensive Privacy Policy**: Full GDPR/CCPA compliant policy
- **Forced Acceptance**: Users must read and accept before app use
- **Version Tracking**: Automatic re-consent when policy updates
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear, scroll-to-bottom requirement with visual feedback

**Files Created**:
- `lib/services/privacy_service.dart` - Privacy policy management
- `lib/pages/privacy_policy_screen.dart` - Interactive privacy policy screen
- `lib/pages/privacy_settings_screen.dart` - Privacy management interface

### 3. GDPR/CCPA Compliance ✅

**Problem**: No compliance with data protection regulations.

**Solution Implemented**:

#### GDPR Compliance:
- **Right to be informed**: Clear privacy policy with all data usage
- **Right of access**: Complete data export functionality  
- **Right to rectification**: Built-in data editing capabilities
- **Right to erasure**: One-click complete data deletion
- **Right to restrict processing**: Granular privacy controls
- **Right to data portability**: JSON export with integrity verification
- **Right to object**: Opt-out options for analytics/crash reporting

#### CCPA Compliance:
- **Right to know**: Transparent data collection disclosure
- **Right to delete**: Complete data deletion with confirmation
- **Right to opt-out**: Analytics and crash reporting toggles
- **Right to non-discrimination**: No feature restrictions for privacy choices

**Files Created**:
- `lib/services/privacy_service.dart` - Full compliance implementation
- `lib/pages/privacy_settings_screen.dart` - User rights interface
- `SECURITY_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation
